        <p>For words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
        </p>
        <p>For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end, and add "ay".</p>
        <p>If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!</p>
        <p>For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant.</p>
